== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why choose Twitterbot over other Wordpress Twitter plugins?

There are lots of Twitter plugins for Wordpress available but I found them too all be bloated and too fully-featured. If you want a simple plugin with a few simple configuration options, Twitterbot is the plugin for you.

= What are the requirements to install this plugin?

It is only tested with the 2.7.x versions of Wordpress. If you don't use this, you should definitely think about upgrading. It also requires cURL to be enabled on your PHP installation

= Can I customise the "New Post" and "Updated Post" prefix text?

Yes, you can change it in the options section

= How can I disable a tweet for a particular post?

When creating a new post, there is a checkbox further down the page. You can turn off a tweet for the current post here
